# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

Modified starter code to create an application that enables the user to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

When the user visits the webpage, they click on a button to generate a password.
When the button is clicked, they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.

The first prompt is for the length of the password. When prompted, the user inputs the desired length. The value is verified so that if the user inputs a string, a non-integer, or they hit "cancel" and enter nothing, an alert box appears informing them that a password cannot be generated, and to please enter a whole number between 8 and 128.

The user is then presented with a series of prompts for password criteria, and can confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The input is validated so that if the user did not choose any character types, an alert box appears informing them that a password cannot be generated, and to please choose at least one character type.

After all prompts are addressed, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria, and is written to the page.
